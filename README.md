# Scale_musuring_robot_car

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing an innovative project aimed at improving the accuracy of measurements in building and structural design. In these fields, the measurement process can introduce errors when performed by humans, leading to potential costs for various stakeholders.

To address this issue, I have designed a robot car capable of calculating the altitude of a certain room or building to a significant extent. This robot car offers the ability to reach areas that are inaccessible to humans at once. It is designed to operate in extreme weather conditions, ensuring its reliability and versatility. Additionally, the robot car includes an automated scale measuring feature, further streamlining the measurement process. Furthermore, it can be controlled remotely by a single person, providing convenience and flexibility.

To facilitate seamless control and data retrieval from the robot car, I have developed a Bluetooth app. This app serves as an interface between the robot car and an Android device. Through the app, users can remotely control the robot car, retrieve measurement data, and visualize the calculated altitude in real-time.

This repository contains the source code of robot, Android app, detailed documentation and installation instructions. With this project, my goal is to offer an effective solution for minimizing measurement errors in building and structural design. Additionally, I have future plans to apply this technology to drones, expanding its potential applications and benefits.

The methodology employed in this project involves utilizing an Arduino board connected to a motor driver shield for motor control. Communication between the Arduino board and a smartphone is facilitated by the HC-05 Bluetooth module. The orientation of the ultrasonic sensor is achieved by two servo motorsâ€”one rotating around the x-axis and the other around the y-axis. Additionally, an accelerometer sensor calculates the inclination of the ultrasonic sensor.
 
I invite you to explore this repository, contribute to its development, and provide valuable feedback. Together, let's revolutionize the field of measurement in building and structural design using robotics technology and mobile applications.
