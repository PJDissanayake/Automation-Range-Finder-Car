# Scale_musuring_robot_car
 I have developed a robot car capable of calculating the altitude of a room or building to a significant extent. This robot car can access hard-to-reach areas and operate in extreme weather conditions. It automates the scale measuring process and allows remote control by a single person. Our future goal is to apply this technology to drones.
